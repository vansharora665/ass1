      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <div style="text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; padding: 20px;">

<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>
  Stepping into IIT Bombay was nothing short of a dream come true. From the moment I walked through the gates of this esteemed institution, I knew my life was about to change, not just academically, but personally and professionally.
</p>

<h2>Academic Growth</h2>
<p>
  The curriculum at IIT Bombay is as demanding as it is enriching. Each course pushed me beyond textbook knowledge, encouraging critical thinking, real-world application, and innovation. The professors, renowned in their fields, were not just teachers but mentors who guided us through the ups and downs of our academic lives.
</p>

<h2>Projects & Research</h2>
<p>
  One of the defining aspects of my time here has been participating in projects that mattered. Whether it was a class-based design challenge or an independent research initiative, I got to dive deep into areas that fascinated me. Collaborating with peers on cutting-edge technology helped me grow not just as a student, but as a thinker and problem solver.
</p>

<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<p>
  Life at IIT Bombay isn’t all about lectures and labs. It's about <em>Mood Indigo</em>, <em>Techfest</em>, cultural nights, hostel rivalries, and the calm of Powai Lake. These experiences have helped shape a well-rounded version of me, someone who knows how to balance ambition with enjoyment.
</p>

<h2>Challenges & Triumphs</h2>
<p>
  Of course, the journey wasn’t always smooth. There were tough semesters, failed experiments, and moments of doubt. But each obstacle taught me resilience. And each triumph, no matter how small, reminded me why I chose this path.
</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
  As I continue this journey, I carry with me not just knowledge, but friendships, memories, and a deeper understanding of myself. IIT Bombay has been more than a college, it has been a forge, shaping me into the person I aspire to become.
